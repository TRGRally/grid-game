# Grid Game

A quick React app I spun up to run the classic Pirate Game. This app is a simple way to show crossed squares and pick random ones for the game. It could probably work for any game that requires a grid of squares. The code isn't my best React work, but it was a fun little project to work on in time for the event.

### React + TypeScript + Vite
